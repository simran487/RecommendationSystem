# RecommendationSystem API
This project provides a FastAPI application that recommends relevant SHL assessment URLs based on a user-provided job description or candidate requirement query. It uses a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique, specifically TF-IDF vectorization combined with Cosine Similarity, to match the user's query against a pre-trained dataset of job requirements and their associated assessments.

# Features
API Interface: Built with FastAPI for modern, asynchronous API development.

Recommendation Logic: Uses pre-trained TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity for semantic matching of job queries.

Fast Startup: Model assets are loaded into memory on application startup for fast prediction times.

Clear Dependencies: All required Python packages are listed in requirements.txt.

Health Check: Includes a /health endpoint for deployment monitoring.

# Prerequisites
To run this API, you must have the following:

Python 3.8+

Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt).

Trained Model Assets in a directory named model_assets/.

# Model Assets Requirement
The API depends on three pre-trained files that must be present in the model_assets directory. These files are typically generated by a separate data analysis/training script (e.g., data_analysis.py).
Asset File	Description	Loaded Variable in api.py
tfidf_vectorizer.pkl	The trained TF-IDF vectorizer object.	tfidf_vectorizer
query_features.pkl	The TF-IDF matrix (features) of the training job queries.	query_features
trained_df.pkl	The original training Pandas DataFrame (used to map indices back to Assessment_url).	trained_df

Path Requirement: The model_assets directory must be in the same root directory as the api.py file.

# Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-project-directory>
Set up the Python virtual environment (Recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
The required packages are pandas, scikit-learn, joblib, fastapi, and uvicorn.

Place the Model Assets: Ensure you have the model_assets directory containing the three required .pkl files.

# Running the API
The API is run using uvicorn, the ASGI server defined in requirements.txt.

Start the server:

uvicorn api:app --reload
The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000. The console will display the successful loading of the model assets.

# API Endpoints
1. POST /recommend
This is the main endpoint for getting assessment recommendations.

Method: POST

URL: /recommend

Description: Accepts a user query (job description) and returns a list of up to 10 recommended SHL assessment URLs.

Request Body (JSON):

JSON

{
  "user_query": "Looking for a candidate assessment for a senior data scientist proficient in Python, SQL, and machine learning models."
}
Response Body (JSON):

JSON

[
  "https://example.com/assessment/data_science_pro",
  "https://example.com/assessment/python_and_ml_expert",
  "https://example.com/assessment/advanced_sql"
  // ... up to 10 URLs
]
2. GET /health
A simple health check endpoint.

Method: GET

URL: /health

Response Body (JSON):

JSON

{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "Recommendation API is running."
}
# Development Notes (api.py)
Startup Logic: The @app.on_event("startup") function handles the loading of all model assets using joblib.load() and pathlib.Path for robust file handling.

Vectorization: The get_recommendations function transforms the incoming user_query using the globally loaded tfidf_vectorizer.

Similarity Calculation: cosine_similarity from sklearn.metrics.pairwise is used to calculate the similarity between the user query vector and all training query features (query_features).

Error Handling: The API includes try...except blocks to handle:

FileNotFoundError during asset loading (preventing startup with a RuntimeError).

RuntimeError in /recommend if assets are not loaded (HTTPException 503 Service Unavailable).

General exceptions during prediction (HTTPException 500 Internal Server Error).
